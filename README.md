# Web Applications for a Non-Banking Financial Institution


For the web application "carp_tm_delegati", 
accessed from remote locations by tablets , Forms Authentication with 2FA is used.
I have activated 2FA for every user and installed Google Authenticator, then entered the secret key generated by 2FA into Google Authenticator.
Users are created with registration and are inserted into the Utilizatoris table, e.g., nume_prenume@ctp.ro and receive an ID.
Then, in the nr_chitanta table, a record is inserted with the user's full name (nume_prenume@ctp.ro) and the ID from the Utilizatoris table.

For the web application "carp_tm_2025", accessed from the central office
authentication is done via Windows Active Directory.
A domain named carp_tm has been created, along with groups CARP_TM_READ and CARP_TM_WRITE.
Authorization is based on membership in the groups CARP_TM\CARP_TM_READ or CARP_TM\CARP_TM_WRITE.
In the Utilizatori table, users are inserted like CARP_TM\smith_jhon, and in the group CARP_TM_READ the user CARP_TM\nume1_prenume1 is added.
Similarly, in the nr_chitanta table, the ID and username are inserted, e.g., CARP_TM\smith_jhon

When a new person is added to the system, they are assigned a nrcarnet and corresponding analytical accounts are automatically created for each operation.
The analytical account number has the format: accountNumber.nrcarnet.
Upon entry, the data is automatically distributed to the accounts.
The accounts are recorded in the analytical accounts and synthetic accounts tables.
Each synthetic account corresponds to one or more analytical accounts.

Both applications handle:

- Collection and payment activities: entering receipts, loans, life insurance payments
- Recording accounting notes, supplier invoices, other expenses
- Calculating interest, penalty interest, loan balances, social fund, life insurance
- Early repayments
- Cash, bank, and journal registers
- Synthetic and analytical trial balances, account statements
- Debtor, creditor, and supplier reports

The database processes over 500,000 transactions annually.
